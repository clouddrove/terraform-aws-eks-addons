# Compliance Baseline Example

Opinionated baseline for teams aligning to SOC2/HIPAA-style technical controls.

## Intent
- Expanded audit and evidence-friendly defaults
- Stronger security controls and explicit operational boundaries
- Manual control checklist expected (outside Terraform scope)

## Usage
Use with your internal compliance matrix and control ownership model.

## Notes
Compliance requires process + people + evidence, not module settings alone.
